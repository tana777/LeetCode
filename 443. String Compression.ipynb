    "##### 443. String Compression\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an array of characters, compress it in-place. The length after compression must always be smaller than or equal to the original array. Every element of the array should be a character (not int) of length 1. After you are done modifying the input array in-place, return the new length of the array.\n",
